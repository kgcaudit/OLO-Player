/**
 * The media player's engine, living in a service so it outlasts the screen.
 *
 * The player used to be built inside the viewer and released when the viewer
 * closed, which meant it stopped the moment the app went to the background and
 * never had a notification. Held here instead, the sound carries on when the
 * phone is put down and media3 posts the playback notification with its
 * controls for free. The viewer connects to this from the front with a
 * MediaController and hands it a playlist; nothing else talks to it.
 *
 * The player also takes and holds audio focus, and pauses when the headphones
 * are pulled out -- the two things a listener expects of anything that plays a
 * sound and neither of which it did before.
