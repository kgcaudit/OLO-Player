/**
 * Asking an `MLSD` server for the facts the app actually shows.
 *
 * `MLSD` does not send everything it knows. RFC 3659 has the server
 * advertise its facts in `FEAT` with an asterisk on the ones currently
 * switched on, and the client turn the rest on with `OPTS MLST`. Most
 * servers switch on `type`, `size`, `modify` and `perm` and leave the unix
 * facts off.
 *
 * Which is why the properties dialog said "unknown" where permissions and
 * owner should be, on servers that knew both: nothing ever asked. `perm`,
 * the one fact that does arrive, is not the file's permissions at all --
 * it lists what this login may do with it -- so there was nothing to fall
 * back on either.
 *
 *     FEAT ->  MLST type*;size*;modify*;perm*;unix.mode;unix.uid;unix.gid;
 *     OPTS MLST type;size;modify;perm;unix.mode;unix.owner;unix.group;
 *
 * Only ever asks for facts the server listed. A server that is sent a fact
 * it does not have answers 501 and, on some implementations, leaves the
 * whole set at the default -- so asking for more than was offered can cost
 * the facts that were already arriving.

     * What is worth asking for, in the order FileZilla asks.
     *
     * `unix.mode` is the permissions. The owner and group are spelt
     * several ways -- a name, an account, a numeric id -- and servers
     * differ in which they have, so every spelling [MlsdParser] reads is
     * asked for.
     *
     * Every one of them, and that is the point rather than thoroughness.
     * A server switches off whatever this command does not name, so a list
     * missing `unix.ownername` would turn off the very fact the listing
     * prefers on a server that already had it on -- asking for more owner
     * information and getting a number back instead of a name.
