/**
 * Runs a transfer while keeping a [TransferJournal] up to date, so it can be
 * picked up again after the process is killed.
 *
 * The journal is written as bytes arrive rather than only at the end. That
 * costs a little, and it is the whole point: Android kills a backgrounded app
 * without warning, and a journal updated only on success would record nothing
 * about the transfer that was actually in flight.
 *
 * Before resuming, [ResumeSafety] checks the recorded offset against what the
 * server says now. A transfer picked up hours later may be pointing at a file
 * that has since been replaced, and no one is watching to answer a prompt
 * about it.
