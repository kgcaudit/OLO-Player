 * This is the half of network-change recovery that lives in the engine. On a
 * phone the usual cause of a failed transfer is not the server but the network
 * moving underneath it -- Wi-Fi to mobile data, a lift, a tunnel -- and the
 * correct response is to reconnect and carry on from where the partial file
 * ends, not to start again.
 *
 * Where each attempt's connection comes from is [ControlConnections]' to say.
 * A failed attempt never reuses one -- the usual reason an attempt fails is
 * that its connection died -- but a successful one can hand its connection to
 * the next transfer, which is what makes a queue of small files worth running.
 *
 * The [ServerCapabilities] cache is shared across attempts on purpose: the
 * 2 GB/4 GB resume probe costs an extra data connection, and repeating it on
 * every reconnect would be exactly the wrong thing to do on a flaky link.
 *
 * The writer and reader arrive as factories rather than instances because each
 * attempt needs its own. A writer is closed when its attempt ends, and closing
 * is what truncates the partial file back to the bytes actually received --
 * which is what makes the next attempt resume from the right offset.
