"""FTPS test server for the integration tests, mimicking vsftpd's
`require_ssl_reuse=YES`.

The data connection must resume the TLS session negotiated on the control
connection, or the transfer is rejected -- the same rule enforced by vsftpd
(require_ssl_reuse=YES, the default), ProFTPD (mod_tls SessionReuse) and
FileZilla Server.

Resumption is detected with OpenSSL's own SSL_session_reused(), reached
through pyOpenSSL's cffi bindings, so the verdict is the real server-side
answer rather than an inference.

Env:
  FTPS_PORT           control port            (default 2121)
  FTPS_PASV_PORTS     passive port range      (default 2230-2240)
  REQUIRE_SSL_REUSE   1 = enforce reuse       (default 1)
  TLS_MAX             "1.2" or "1.3"          (default 1.2)
  STALL_AFTER_BYTES   go silent after N bytes (default 0, never)
  STALL_TIMES         how many may stall      (default 0, all of them)
  FTPS_ENCODING       wire encoding for paths (default utf8)
  CWD_ECHOES_PATH     1 = name the path in the CWD reply (default 1)
  MLSD_FULL_MODE      1 = unix.mode carries setuid/sticky   (default 1)
