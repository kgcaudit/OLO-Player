/**
 * Stopping a transfer that has stopped receiving.
 *
 * The bug these cover, reported from a phone: the network went, the card sat
 * at the same byte count showing the same speed, and the pause button did
 * nothing. Nothing was wrong with the pause -- it was delivered through the
 * progress callback, and the engine calls that as bytes arrive. No bytes, no
 * pause.
 *
 * So the server here stops sending without closing anything, which is what
 * the phone saw, and the read parks exactly as it did on the device. The read
 * timeout is left long on purpose: it is what the old code waited for, and a
 * test that shortened it would pass on the bug.
